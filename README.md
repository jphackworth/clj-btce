# clj-btce

API Library for BTC-E

## Changes from 0.0.2 to 0.1.0

### Libraries

- Removed a lot of libraries that were left in 0.0.2 for testing. Startup should be much faster
- Using [Cheshire](https://github.com/dakrone/cheshire) for json parsing

### Configuration

- Configuration is now centrally stored in @config map 
- Credentials configured the same as in 0.0.2
- New @config keys include :keepalive (in ms), :insecure (allow insecure http request), :trade-api-url, :public-api-url, :user-agent

### Trade api calls 

- Data previously in :return key, now returned at top-level. In other words: (:return (btce/get-info)) in 0.0.2 is now (btce/get-info) in 0.1.x.

### Error handling

- Exceptions are raised if :api-key or :api-secret is not set, and a trade api call is made
- If HTTP response is not 200, an exception is raised with the unparsed HTTP response 
- If HTTP response code is 200 and there is an error, an exception will be raised with the parsed response body as a map.

## Installation
