(defn nonce 
  "The BTC-E API requires each request to include a unique and incremented nonce integer parameter.
  
  I suspect this is to reduce the possibility of API users from overloading the system with 
  parallel requests. The requirement for each new API request to have an incremented nonce 
  is difficult to share safely across threads.
  
  This function provides an abbreviated time-based nonce. If you need to run parallel requests,
  then you will need to implement your own nonce-management scheme and call post-data directly.
